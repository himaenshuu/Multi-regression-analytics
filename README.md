# Regression Algorithms Comparison

This project implements and compares seven different regression algorithms on two distinct datasets, with comprehensive visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Project Overview

This implementation focuses on analyzing the performance of various regression algorithms across different datasets. By visualizing and comparing results, the project provides insights into which algorithms perform best for specific data characteristics.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following regression algorithms are implemented and compared:

1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Robust Regression — RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression
6. Gaussian Process Regression
7. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Datasets

The analysis is performed on two different datasets:
- Dataset 1: Cricket (batting-dataset)
- Dataset 2: Cricket (bowling-dataset)

*Note: Replace with your actual dataset names and descriptions*

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Feature selection/engineering
- Training/test split

### Model Training
Each algorithm is trained with optimized hyperparameters to ensure fair comparison.

### Evaluation Metrics
Performance is measured using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²) score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Visualization

The project includes comprehensive visualizations:
- Performance comparison charts for all algorithms
- Prediction vs. actual value plots
- Residual plots
- Learning curves
- Feature importance plots (where applicable)

All visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
